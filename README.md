# Synchronous_Buck_ENEL373
A simple synchronous buck converter designed for ENEL373's Solar Car Project the University of Canterbury.
Although the project specification only asked for a regular buck converter, I and my group decided that a synchronous converter would give us a better chance of winning the race due to the extra efficiency a synchronous converter provides.
